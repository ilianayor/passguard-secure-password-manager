# PassGuard – Secure Password Manager

* PassGuard is a secure password manager designed to provide safe storage and management of user credentials.  
* The application combines a modern technology stack (**Java**, **Spring Boot**, **React**, **PostgreSQL**) with proven cryptographic practices.  
* All stored passwords are encrypted using **AES-GCM**, ensuring both confidentiality and integrity.  
* The system supports **multi-factor authentication (2FA)** via Google Authenticator, role-based access control, audit logs, and advanced security mechanisms such as brute-force protection and password strength validation.

## Requirements
Before running the project, make sure you have installed and configured:  
1. **pgAdmin 4** (for PostgreSQL database management)  
2. **Java 17** or newer version
3. **Node.js** with **npm**  
4. **Google Authenticator** mobile app (for MFA/2FA)

## Installation and Setup

### Step 1 – Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ilianayor/passguard-secure-password-manager
cd passguard-secure-password-manager
```

### Step 2 – Create the database
Open pgAdmin 4 and create a new PostgreSQL database with the name:
`passmanager`

### Step 3 – Configure environment variables
Set the following environment variables in your system (values depend on your setup):

```
DB_HOST
DB_PORT
DB_NAME
DB_USERNAME
DB_PASSWORD
JWT_SECRET
JWT_EXPIRATION
ADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD
ENCRYPTION_SECRET_KEY
MAIL_USERNAME
MAIL_PASSWORD
FRONTEND_URL
RESET_PASSWORD_PATH
MAX_ATTEMPT
LOCK_TIME_MINUTES
```

### Step 4 – Start the Backend (Spring Boot)
From the back-end project folder, run:

``` 
mvn spring-boot:run
```


### Step 5 – Start the Frontend (React)
From the front-end project folder, run:


```
npm install
npm start
```


### Step 6 – Open the application 
Open your browser and navigate to the URL set in your environment variable:

`FRONTEND_URL`

For local development, this is usually:

`http://localhost:3000`

### Step 7 – Log in
Use the following credentials to log in:

**Username**: `admin`

**Password**: the value of the environment variable `ADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD`



### Step 8 – Enable 2FA (optional)
1. Install **Google Authenticator** on your mobile device.
2. Scan the QR code generated by the application during setup.
3. Enter the 6-digit code from the app to complete login.
